# angular-tmdb
A good attempt at Angular to create an IMDB clone.

This is a simple angular website that was built in a web technologies course. There are quite a few issues with the CSS on certain resolutions and monitors; however, 
the fundamentals are there. Certain concessions with the services and components had to be made due to time crunch, but I believe it demonstrates a level of ingenuity to
get a proof of concept out. There are certain best practices that I would like to go back and fix at some point or revamp this project in angular, but it demonstrates
aptitude to quickly learn a framework with less than 2 weeks to build an entire website clone with minimal assistance beyond tutorials while working full time.
